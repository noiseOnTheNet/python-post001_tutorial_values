This is the first post in a tutorial series about Python. I wrote it to leave
some material for my students but also for anyone who may find it useful
* Why Python

Everyone has different reasons to learn a programming language so I'm going
to list a few which may or may not fit to your need:
- Learning to use Python is easier than other languages
- Python is widely used from schools to enterprises
- There are a lot of powerful extensions
- There is a large community of developers
- There is a lot of tutorials available

* How to use this tutorial
I attempted to present Python without forward references and adding many details
I found useful in real applications.

Chapters are designed to be read in order; you can also choose a specific topic
and read it autonomously: in case something is used which is not explained in
the chapter you read, it should be explained in one of the previous. For this
reason I believe this index can be a good point to navigate all the chapters
forth and back

1. Setting up your environment
2. The python REPL
3. Some python literals, values and operators
4. Main containers
5. Variables and mutability
6. Basic Builtin Functions
7. Structured programming
8. Functions, environment and closures
9. Scripts
10. Modules
11. Introduction to object oriented programming
12. Exceptions
13. Introduction to filesystem and file IO
14. Overriding of python operators
15. Iterators and generators
16. Coroutines
17. Introduction to functional programming

I will refactor the chapter from time to time to fix errors, add information and
improve readability
