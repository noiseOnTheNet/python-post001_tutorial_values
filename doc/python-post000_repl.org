We are going to explore one of the most interesting feature of python: an
interactive command line also known as REPL

* What the *$! does REPL mean?
REPL acronym stands for
- Read (the computer reads what you typed and if it respects Python grammar rules transforms it into executable code)
- Eval (the python interpreter executes your code and get a result)
- Print (the python interpreter prints the result in a line below your text)
- Loop (Let's start all over again)

* Why should this interest me?

Instead of writing a program the REPL allows you to add a few commands at a time
and immediately see the output

This allow you to get an immediate feedback and quickly explore various
solutions with a "live" environment; you can build your calculations stepwise: I
recommend to make experiments with this when possible as this will speed up your
learning.

* How do I use the Python REPL
#+begin_export html
<script src="https://modularizer.github.io/pyprez/pyprez.min.js"></script>
#+end_export
Directly from your browser...

#+begin_export html
<pyprez-editor>
print("get ready...â™¥")
print(5,3,2,1,0,"rocket launch")
</pyprez-editor>
#+end_export

Or you can launch from a command line in your PC typing "python"

- Each command line starts with three > sign
- once the command is completed type enter and see the result
- multiline commands show a "..."  prompt -- this will allow you to break long commands in smaller pieces

* But... then I lose all I wrote?

Short answer yes. But...

Actually there are many awesome extensions which allow you to:
- save your code and results
- see graphical outputs
- create documents including text and formulae in a lot of formats
- mixing results with other programming languages snippets
- easily execute operations on your PC
- share your work with others
- and much more

Just to name a few:
- [[https://ipython.org/][IPython]] (I often use an extension called PTIPython)
- [[https://jupyter.org/][Jupyter Notebook]] (which executes many other programming languages too)
- [[https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/][Jupyter Lab]] (which does way more than execute code: remote terminals, file editing etc.)
- [[https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/][Jupyter Lite]] (which does the same things without any installation)
