#+title: Python Tutorial: Variables

In the previous posts we learnt how to create values by typing into the python
REPL, however the computation we made were somehow "volatile".

Starting from this post I would suggest you to use an editor to type python
code: we will execute our python files and there will be some exercise available

* What are variables?

* Identity and equivalence
* Assignment and update
* Mutability of a value
* Deleting a variable
* Yes, but what are variables actually?
what actually happens in Python is called "binding".

This means we are "connecting" a name with a value.

What python actually does is to use some special "dictionaries" we call
"environments" to actually create the connection between names ("keys") and "values"
* Garbage collection is a noble job
